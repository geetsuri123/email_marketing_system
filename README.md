# email_marketing_system
<br>
An online retailer, “Universal Plus”, requested us to pitch to win a major contract with them to develop and deploy an e-mail marketing system.
Universal Plus aims to use direct e-mail marketing to reach out to their customers and increase sales.
Marketing decisions are critical to their success. Currently, their decisions about who to mail the
marketing promotions are mostly done through rules of thumb or randomly selecting their customers.
However, targeting uninterested customers costs to the company. In the past, some of their e-mail
marketing campaigns were not successful. Universal Plus would like to implement a direct marketing
system to identify their target group for the marketing campaign. With this system, they want to
predict which customers will visit the shop as a result of a direct e-mail campaign. This way, they can
target the right customers. Several other consultancy companies have been approached as well, and
the final decision on who will get the contract will largely depend on the outcome of a demonstration
of the approach to this problem based on a dataset that Universal Plus provided.
